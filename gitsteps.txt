Fetch the latest commits from the remote
        git fetch origin


This downloads all new commits and branches from the remote without changing your working files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

step-by-step Git command sequence to push all your changes safely to your repository. I’ll assume your remote is called origin and your branch is main.

1️⃣ Check the current status

     git status


This will show which files are changed, untracked, or staged.

2️⃣ Add all changes

      git add .


. means add all modified and new files.

3️⃣ Commit your changes

    git commit -m "Your commit message here"


Replace "Your commit message here" with a meaningful description.

4️⃣ Pull remote changes first (to avoid errors)

    git pull origin main --rebase


This ensures your local branch is up-to-date and avoids conflicts.

5️⃣ Push your changes

    git push origin main

⚠ Notes

If your repo uses master instead of main, replace main with master.

If you get a merge conflict during git pull, Git will tell you which files need manual resolution.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    git log --oneline -5

above command Shows the last 5 commits in your branch.

Your latest commit should appear at the top.

if you want to undo all the changes you just staged, committed, and maybe even pushed using the commands above. 
How you do it depends on how far you want to undo. Let’s go step by step.

Case 1: You have staged/committed changes locally but NOT pushed yet

1️⃣ Undo last commit but keep changes in working directory:

git reset --soft HEAD~1


HEAD~1 = undo the last commit

--soft = keeps your changes unstaged so you can edit or recommit

2️⃣ Undo last commit AND discard changes completely:

git reset --hard HEAD~1


WARNING: this permanently deletes the last commit and all changes

Case 2: You have already pushed your changes

If you already pushed the commit(s) to remote and want to revert:

1️⃣ Revert last pushed commit safely (without rewriting history):

git revert HEAD


This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the last commit.

Safe for shared repos because it doesn’t rewrite history.

2️⃣ Force reset remote branch (dangerous!)

git reset --hard origin/main
git push origin main --force


This will erase your pushed changes on remote and locally.

Only use if you are sure no one else is working on the branch.

Case 3: You just want to discard all local changes (unstaged, staged, committed)
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git clean -fd


Resets your branch to exactly match the remote

Deletes untracked files and directories
